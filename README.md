CubeBlocks.sbc Modifier
==========

This is a basic python script that modifies a file from the game Space Engineers.
This was made back when SE was in its early stage of development and was designed to change the build times of all objects within the game to make multiplayer and singleplayer faster and more enjoyable.
As of today ~2017, this feature is now built into the game and this program is no longer useful.
